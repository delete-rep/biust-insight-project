## What is this project about ❓❓

The Biust Insight Project is primarily an early stage interactive library and data archieve . Currently not much is implemented, however (almost) everything inside this repository is being created with the aassistance of a variety of students in the community.

## Getting Started

### Requiremnts

- | droidscript
- | node
- | git

### Downloading the repository

Start by cloning the repository with

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/halo-saber/biust-insight-project`
```

#### Install Dependencies

```bash
cd biust-insight-project
npm install
```

#### Run the Development Server

```bash
npm start
```

The site will be available at <http://localhost:3000>.

#### Build the project

```bash
npm run build
```

#### Building on DroidScript

Now that you have cloned the repository, in DroidScript or you are editing it through vscode, create a project and choose type as Node.

Then select all the files under the android folder to become the base files for the android project.

You will then need to install the following plugins:

- [Material Design](https://github.com/oarabiledev/material-design)
- [Support](https://ds.justplayer.de/projects/support)
- [DsNav](https://ds.justplayer.de/projects/dsnav-demo-app)
- [Lottie](https://ds.justplayer.de/projects/lottie)

These can be downloaded at the [DroidStore](ds.justplayer.de).

After configuring accordingly to the DroidScript file structure, you can run the application and build an android binary.

However you could simply just install the script package file (.spk) in the *packages* folder in the android folder to ignore all the file configuration steps.
